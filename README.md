# jet-game
*A simple game made with HTML5 canvas.*

*Note: this is very much a work in progress.*

## Running

Clone the files to your local machine.

Then, run an HTTP server on the directory that holds the files. 

For example, you could use python 3 and run <br>
`cd <YOUR DIRECTORY>` followed by <br>
`python -m http.server <PORT>`

Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:<PORT>/jet_game.html`
